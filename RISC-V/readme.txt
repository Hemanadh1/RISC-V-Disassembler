Assembly Code to RISC-V Instructions Compiler
This program takes a file containing hexadecimal instructions and compiles them into RISC-V assembly code. It supports a variety of RISC-V instructions, including branching and jumping operations.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

C++ Compiler: You need a C++ compiler to build and run the program.
Input File: Prepare a text file containing hexadecimal instructions. Each line should represent a single instruction in hexadecimal format.
How to Use:
compilation:
         g++ q1.cpp
execution:
          ./a.out    
then we have to give name of input file
eg:input.txt
